#### Parallele coordinates plot 
Visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing multivariate data for profile and survey data,
serving data from online CSV: https://github.com/antoinedme/SurveyPulseView1/blob/master/PULSEDATAVIEWIMT.csv
Available data parameters are:
- `age_group` Participant's age (years old)
- `bmi_score` Calculated (Body Mass Index), approximate measure of your total body fat
- `framingham` The Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Score estimates
- `score` General Well-being Risk Score estimates
- `monthly_steps` Estimated wearable or declared physical activity

A point in *n-dimensional* space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point. 
Used for *statistical considerations* and *cohort identification/selection*.
