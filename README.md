visualizing high-dimensional geometry and analyzing multivariate data for profile and survey data,
serving data from online CSV: https://github.com/antoinedme/SurveyPulseView1/blob/master/PULSEDATAVIEWIMT.csv

A point in *n-dimensional* space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point.
